SPECIAL ABILITIES
=================================================
[b]Alchemy (Su)[/b] When using Craft (Alchemy) to create an alchemical item, you gains a +4 competence bonus on the Craft (alchemy) check. In addition, you can use Craft (Alchemy) to identify potions as if using Detect Magic. He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.

[b]Bomb (Su)[/b] You can use 8 bombs each day. Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus. On a direct hit, your bomb inflicts 1d6+4 points of fire damage. Your bombs also inflict an additional 1d6 points of fire damage that is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike. Splash damage from an your bomb is always equal to the bomb's minimum damage (6). Those caught in the splash damage can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save for half damage.

[b]Bonus Extract Formula (2x)[/b] Add one extract formulae from the alchemist's list to the character's formulae book. This formulae must be at least one level below the highest formulae level the alchemist can create.

[b]Bonus Feat[/b] Humans select one extra feat at 1st level.

[b]Brew Potion (Ex)[/b] You receive Brew Potion as a bonus feat. You can brew potions of any formulae you know (up to 3rd level), using your alchemist level as caster level. The spell must be one that can be made into a potion. You do not need to meet the prerequisites for this feat.

[b]Firebug[/b] You were the child of a gunsmith or alchemist and always enjoyed experimenting with fery alchemical items and minor explosives. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls made with thrown splash weapons and alchemist bombs.

[b]Focused Burn[/b] [Not Implemented] You know the secret of making punishing fire bombs. Any bombs you have that deal fire damage deal 1 additional point of fire damage on a direct hit per 2d6 of fire damage normally dealt (minimum 1 point). This additional damage does not apply to the bomb's splash damage.

[b]Frost Bomb*[/b] When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.

[b]Mutagen (Su)[/b] You know how to create a mutagen that you can imbibe in order to heighten your physical prowess at the cost of your personality. It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent until used. You can only maintain one dose of mutagen at a time - if you brews a second dose, any existing mutagen becomes inert. A mutagen that is not in your possession becomes inert until an alchemist picks it up again. When you brew a mutagen, you select one physical ability score - either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. It's a standard action to drink a mutagen. Upon being imbibed, the mutagen causes you to grow bulkier and more bestial, granting you a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 40 minutes. In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your mental ability scores. If the mutagen enhances your Strength, it applies a penalty to your Intelligence. If it enhances your Dexterity, it applies a penalty to your Wisdom. If it enhances your Constitution, it applies a penalty to your Charisma. A non-alchemist who drinks a mutagen must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour - a non-alchemist can never gain the benefit of a mutagen, but an alchemist can gain the effects of another alchemist's mutagen if he drinks it. (Although if the other alchemist creates a different mutagen, the effects of the "stolen" mutagen immediately cease.) The effects of a mutagen do not stack. Whenever an alchemist drinks a mutagen, the effects of any previous mutagen immediately end.

[b]Mutagen (Third Stat Selection)[/b] 

[b]Poison Resistance (Ex)[/b] You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison.

[b]Poison Use (Ex)[/b] You are trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

[b]Skilled[/b] Humans gain an additional skill rank at first level and one additional rank whenever they gain a level.

[b]Swift Alchemy (Ex)[/b] You can create alchemical items with astounding speed. It takes you half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items, and you can apply poison to a weapon as a move action.

[b]Tanglefoot Bomb* (Su)[/b] A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb's DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a tanglefoot bag (see page 160 of the Core Rulebook). Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.

[b]Throw Anything (Ex)[/b] You gain the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat. You add your Intelligence modifier to damage done with splash weapons, including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.
